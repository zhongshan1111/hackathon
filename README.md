# CDL Quantum Hackathon 2022
# Description
The quantum hackathon will be a competition in which teams of the CDL Quantum program participants intensively develop a quantum software project or application over the course of 48 hours. Participants will utilize one of the quantum platforms provided by CDLâ€™s Technical Partners to produce a set of code that implements a quantum algorithm for a chosen application.

The problem a team decides to tackle will be up to the team. To facilitate problem identification, technical partners will present relevant problems (challenges) which we hope will provide inspiration and insight when the teams are deciding what to work on.
